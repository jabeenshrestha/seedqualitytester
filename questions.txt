The questions regarding our project are:
1) Some of the output categories are not predicted accurately; so how can we modify our CNN architecture so as to increase the accuracy ?
2) We have tried implementing the CNN model as protobuf (.pb) file in android, everything worked fine but could't locate the error; so how can we implement this model in android?
